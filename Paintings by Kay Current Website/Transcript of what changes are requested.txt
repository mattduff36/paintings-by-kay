Unknown Speaker  
Right. Okay, it's recording so,

Unknown Speaker  
so what don't you like about the left at the minute? Don't like all the pump in it, all the La di da fancy stuff? I want it to just be natural about me. How I started? How did you start my artist career? It's

Unknown Speaker  
not a career, it's a hobby.

Unknown Speaker  
By watching Bob Ross and he got me into painting in 2013

Unknown Speaker  
and I enjoyed it, and I love painting, and it just

Unknown Speaker  
relaxation, just a relaxation for me and a hobby. But if anybody likes my paint inside you solve it.

Unknown Speaker  
You're talking like you're talking to an advert. And I do do a few commissions, but not people. I don't like painting people, animals, trees, skies, water. So like,

Unknown Speaker  
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  
nature. What's the word? Like background scenery?

Unknown Speaker  
What about the seaside? If I like a picture of photographs

Unknown Speaker  
and I like the colors in it, then I paint

Unknown Speaker  
it photographs, pictures, what? What are the paints? What type of paints, acrylic, and all yours, but mostly acrylic.

Unknown Speaker  
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  
don't do water. I'm.
